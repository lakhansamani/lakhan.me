## Motivation behind [Authorizer](https://authorizer.dev)

- Didn't want to implement the same logic again and again
- Needed single source of data. If I use 3rd party services user data might be at different places and application data might be at a different place.
- Didn't want to pay for services like [auth0](https://auth0.com/) based on user count. This model is painful as application scales.
- Needed authorization service always running as it can add more latency if implemented with serverless architecture, which will put service to sleep when not used. Also, it can come with the complexity of more open DB connections as the app scales
- Needed a graphical representation of user data, that is the reason I used GraphQL which will help us link user information with other application data and generate the linked graph (Helpful when the application is using GraphQL under the hood)

## Check how you can integrate this with React Application
